# Operator Precedence

Operator precedence is implemented through grammar definitions. By placing higher-priority elements
into sub-categories, you force the parser to branch into those first, resulting in earlier
evaluation.

Consider the following example:

```parol
%start Precedence
%title "Operator precedence"
%comment "Shows the handling of operator precedence in `parol`"

%%

// ---------------------------------------------------------
// VARIABLE
Variable: /(?i)[A-Z][0-9A-Z]*/ ;
Literal : /[0-9]+/ ;

// ---------------------------------------------------------
// OPERATOR SYMBOLS
Plus    : '+' ;
Minus   : '-' ;
MulOp   : "\*|/" ;

// ---------------------------------------------------------
// PARENTHESIS
LParen  : '(' ;
RParen  : ')' ;

// ---------------------------------------------------------
// EXPRESSIONS in order of increasing precedence
Precedence      : Summation ;
Summation       : Multiplication { (Plus | Minus) Multiplication } ;
Multiplication  : Factor { MulOp Factor } ;
Factor          : Literal
                | Variable
                | Minus Factor
                | LParen Precedence RParen ;
```

Parsing the string `-1 + x * 5` with the generated parser produces the following parse tree:

![Parse Tree](./precedence/test.svg)

Notice that the innermost operator is evaluated first by the parserâ€”here, the negation in the
`Factor` production.

`Multiplication` is the second-highest priority in this example, as it is a sub-category of
`Summation`.

To try this grammar, run:

```shell
parol new --bin --path .\precedence --tree
```

Replace the generated dummy grammar with the example above. Also, set `test.txt` to:

```text
-1 + x * 5
```

Parse the text by running:

```shell
cargo run ./test.txt
```

from the root of the generated crate.

Because the `--tree` flag was used with `parol new`, parse trees are generated automatically. Look
for a `test.svg` file next to `test.txt`.

It is recommended to use parse tree generation during grammar development and remove it when
deploying your parser in production.

***However, the parse tree can be useful in certain scenarios. Because it's lossless, it also
includes otherwise discarded tokens like spaces.***

## How do I implement the grammar processing?

You should have a look at the example [calc](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol/tree/main/examples/calc).

Basically, the grammar processing is implemented in the `calc_grammar.rs`.

The struct `CalcGrammar` contains a collection of variables and their values called `env`.
It also contains a stack of values that holds the intermediate results during the calculation:
```rust
pub calc_results: Vec<DefinitionRange>,
pub env: BTreeMap<String, DefinitionRange>,
```

You can extend the struct `PrecedenceGrammar` in `src\precedence_grammar.rs` the same way.

Now you can implement selected semantic actions from the `PrecedenceGrammarTrait`. Look at the
generated `src\precedence_grammar_trait.rs`. It contains all available semantic actions which are
bound to non-terminals.

To implement for instance the `variable` action, copy the `fn variable...` block into the
```rust
impl<'t> PrecedenceGrammarTrait<'t> for PrecedenceGrammar<'t> {

}
```

This way:

```rust
impl<'t> PrecedenceGrammarTrait<'t> for PrecedenceGrammar<'t> {
    /// Semantic action for non-terminal 'Variable'
    fn variable(&mut self, _arg: &Variable<'t>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Semantic action for non-terminal 'Precedence'
    fn precedence(&mut self, arg: &Precedence<'t>) -> Result<()> {
        self.precedence = Some(arg.clone());
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Now you can handle any variable. Because our grammar has no assignment yet, the function is simple.
It tries to retrieve the variables value from the `env`. If the variable is not found in the `env`
it creates a new entry with default value 0. Then it pushes this value on the `calc_results` vector
for later processing:


```rust
    /// Semantic action for non-terminal 'Variable'
    fn variable(&mut self, var: &Variable<'t>) -> Result<()> {
        // Try to find the variable in the environment
        let value = if let Some(value) = self.env.get(var.variable.text()) {
            *value
        } else {
            // Insert default value for unassigned variable
            self.env
                .insert(var.variable.text().to_string(), DefinitionRange::default());
            DefinitionRange::default()
        };
        self.calc_results.push(value);
        Ok(())
    }
```

Don't forget to `use` the type `Variable` from the module `precedence_grammar_trait`.

To see the results modify the Display implementation of `PrecedenceGrammar` to show the intermediate
results and the environment.

```rust
impl Display for PrecedenceGrammar<'_> {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::result::Result<(), Error> {
        writeln!(
            f,
            "Result stack\n{}",
            self.calc_results
                .iter()
                .rev()
                .map(|e| format!("{}", e))
                .collect::<Vec<String>>()
                .join("\n")
        )?;
        writeln!(
            f,
            "\nEnv\n{}",
            self.env
                .iter()
                .map(|(i, v)| format!("{} = {}", i, v))
                .collect::<Vec<String>>()
                .join("\n")
        )
    }
}
```

```shell
    cargo run ./test.txt
Parsing took 0 milliseconds.
Success!
Result stack
0

Env
x = 0
```

As expected the variable `x` has been inserted into the environment with default value 0.
The Value 0 is still on the stack.

Now the next step could be to implement the semantic action for non-terminal `Literal`:


```rust
    /// Semantic action for non-terminal 'Literal'
    fn literal(&mut self, lit: &Literal<'t>) -> Result<()> {
        // Convert the integer literal to its value
        let lit = lit
            .literal
            .text()
            .parse::<DefinitionRange>()
            .map_err(|e| parol!(format!("Cannot convert literal to integer: {}", e)))?;
        // Push it onto the calculation stack
        self.calc_results.push(lit);
        Ok(())
    }
```

```shell
    cargo run ./test.txt
Parsing took 0 milliseconds.
Success!
Result stack
5
0
1

Env
x = 0
```

Now I think you could continue on your own. Implement the unary and binary operations by taking one
or two top most numbers from the calculation stack and push the result on the stack again.
If all is implemented correctly the end result of the calculation should be laying as single value
on top of the calculation stack.

`-1 + x * 5` should the result into `-1 + 0 * 5` => `-1`.

Now you could add assignments to your Grammar to be able to use variables to store and access values.
Allow the grammar to contain multiple operations and remove assigned values from the calculation
stack.
