# Example application "JSON Parser"

This is an example project of the [`parol`](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol) parser generator.
It is part of the documentation of `parol`. It uses the new auto-generation feature of `parol` which
is available as of version 0.6.0.

You can compare it with the traditional approach applied here: [JSON parser](https://github.com/jsinger67/json_parser.git).

## Performance evaluation

For best performance results please use a release build and add the parameter -q (quiet) after the
file name. But keep in mind that this crate is designed for didactical usage and therefore
performance is not the main goal.
